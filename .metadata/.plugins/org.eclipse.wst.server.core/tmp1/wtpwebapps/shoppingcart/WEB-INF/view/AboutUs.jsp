<p><h3>THE BEGINNING</h3>
The Enfield Cycle Company made motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowersand stationary enginesunder the name Royal Enfield out of its works based at Redditch,Worcestershire.
The legacy of weapons manufacture is reflected in the logo comprising the cannon, and the motto "Made like a gun".Use of the brand name Royal Enfield was licensed by the Crown in 1890
<h3>THE EARLY YEARS</h3>
In 1909 Royal Enfield surprised the motorcycling world by introducing a small Motorcycle with a 2 ¼ HP V twin Motosacoche engine of Swiss origin.
In 1911 the next model was powered by a 2 ¾ HP engine and boasted of the well known Enfield 2-speed gear.
In 1912 came the JAP 6 HP 770 CC V twin with a sidecar combination.
It was this motorcycle which made Enfield a household name.
1914 saw the 3 HP motorcycles this time with Enfields own engine which now had the standardised Enfield paint scheme of black enamelled parts and green tank with gold trim.</p>></center>
